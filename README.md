# Verovio score selection

This project is out of date and has been replaced with https://github.com/trompamusic/DigitalScoreEdition

This is a React application that loads an MEI score, renders it using
[Verovio](http://www.verovio.org/index.xhtml) and allows the user to select
musical elements on the score.

It was a prototype to determine if this stack could be used for the Trompa
Score Edition Component.
